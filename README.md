# Pictureframe

Author: Kevin BÃ¶ckler

## Intention

This software is a lightweight web server which acts as a platform for your digital picture frame. That means you can
start the server and navigate in your browser to the served wesbite. It will show you pictures from a Webdav source and
some more "widgets".

## Usage

After configuring and starting the server, simply navigate inside your browser to [http://localhost:8000]().

## Installation

### Get the binary

Download or compile yourself by running

`env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build`

replacing the target runtime as you like.

### Install the binary

You can simply extract the bundle _pictureframe.zip_ into an arbitrary folder on your picture frame backend.

The following file structure must be present:

- install_dir
    - `pictureframe` (or `pictureframe.exe`)
    - config.json
    - www/ - directory

### Configuration

Make a copy of _config.json_example_ and name it _config.json_. Put it next to your executable.

A sample configuration file looks as follows:

```json

    "ip": "127.0.0.1",

#### Openweathermap.org

To use the weather information, go to [Create New Account](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and create a
free subscription. An E-Mail will be sent to you holding you _appid_.

### Security

As of now _pictureframe_ will only be run on a device within the local network and will not be exposed to the internet (
ingoing). So this software does not expose its webinterface via https.

I recommend creating service users which have only so many priviliges as necessary for your webdav/caldav instance.

### Admin UI and REST interface

A service file could be looking as follows:

The Admin UI is served at [http://localhost:8000/admin.html]() and provides a simple way to set the backend software to
hibernation mode (which does not reindex files or update the current view on the frontend - this saves energy and
bandwith).

You can also use the light REST Api to controlthe hibernation state similar to the Admin UI:

HTTP GET /hibernate

Response 200:

```json
{
  "hibernate": false
}
```

HTTP POST /hibernate

Requestbody

```json
{
  "hibernate": false
}
```

Response 204

### Controlling the backend with hook scripts

There is a possibility to execute multiple script files (such as .sh or .bat files) whenever the _pictureframe_ software
has been toggled from hibernation to awake or vice versa.

Once configured in _config.json_, you can e.g. control your backend to shut off the monitor (useful, when you backend is
really only a picture frame).

In the example config above, we just execute _hibernateOn.bat_ or _hibernateOff.bat_, which can then be scripted as you
wish.

# Contributing

Feel free to make changes or create Feature requests. It is however not my first priority to maintain this project.

# Known Issues

- At the moment most of the _config.json_ has to be filled, so the service isn't very flexible in configuration. I.e.
  you need to set a webdav, caldav and openweather data source to run this program.
